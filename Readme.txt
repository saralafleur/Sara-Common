Sara Common
-----------
As an Engineer, while working in any language, we always end up 
creating a standard library. These libraries fill in the gaps, 
group common logic together, or provide different forms of 
syntactical sugar. 'Sara Common' is my standard library for C#.

Supported Framework
-------------------
The majority is built using .NET Standard. The hope is that this 
Library can be used by multiple platforms. Code that is unique to 
a given platform will exist in a separate project.
